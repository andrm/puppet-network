**Usage**

node "server.domain.com" inherits basenode {
	# physical interface
	network::interface { "eth0":
		hostname => "server.domain.com",
		ipaddress => 1.2.3.4",
		gateway => "1.2.3.1",
		netmask => 255.255.255.0",
		network => 1.2.3.0",
		broadcast => 1.2.3.255",
		macaddress => "ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff",
		ensure => up
	}

	# aliased interface
	network::alias { "eth0:1":
		ipaddress => "1.2.3.5",
		netmask => "255.255.255.0",
		network => "1.2.3.0",
		broadcast => "1.2.3.255",
		ensure => up
	}
}

**Miscellaneous notes**

Probably only works with RH-ish systems.
